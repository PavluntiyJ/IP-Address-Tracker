## Overview

The IP Address Tracker is a web application designed to provide detailed information about any IP address entered by the user. The app leverages the IP Geolocation API to fetch and display data, including the location (region and country), time zone, and Internet Service Provider (ISP) for the specified IP address. Additionally, it features a dynamic map to visually pinpoint the location.
